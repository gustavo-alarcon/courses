### DAPP Architecture Lifecycle

Let's cover at a high level what we just did to create our smart contract. We first wrote our contract in Solidity. Then deployed it to the Rinkeby Testnetwork, and finally made a call by clicking on the public variable we created in Remix. 

This lifecycle can be mapped with the diagram below. Is it starting to click now? It's almost as if our contract is like an API endpoint and once we create and deploy our contract, we then will interface with those endpoints using a library like Web3.js and your favorite front-end framework (React, Vue, etc).
